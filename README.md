# Create-Inject.py
A small python script that can be used to create processes on Windows x64 and inject them with shellcode! This was made as part of TCM Security's Python 201 for Hackers course!

# Purpose
This tool is used to create processes (which by default is notepad.exe) and inject shellcode in them. This is deceptive and can be used when tricking a user to start a process they never intended to.

# Requirements
All modules needed can be found in requirements.txt

# Usage
This Python script is designed exclusively for authorized security testing and penetration testing purposes to assess the strength of Windows systems, and should only be used with explicit permission from the system owner; any unauthorized or illegal use for malicious hacking attempts is strictly prohibited and may result in severe legal consequences. To use this tool, run `python Create-Inject.py` in a PowerShell window!
